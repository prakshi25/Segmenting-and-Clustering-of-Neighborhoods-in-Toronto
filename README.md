# Segmenting-and-Clustering-of-Neighborhoods-in-Toronto
This module is to explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on the postalcode and borough information. However, unlike New York, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet. What is interesting about the field of data science is that each project can be challenging in its unique way, so you need to learn to be agile and refine the skill to learn new libraries and tools quickly depending on the project. For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information needed to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. To fetch information required Webscrapping is done on the Wikipedia page and after which the data is wrangled, cleaned, and then read into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset. Once the data is in a structured format, then the analysis was replicated to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.
